  - Application/
  - Domain/
  - Infrastructure/  
  - Presentation/
- Maintain all functionality with better structure
- SOLID principles applied

**Day 20: Advanced LINQ**
- Complex LINQ query examples
- Performance optimization patterns
- Projection and grouping examples
- N+1 prevention

**Day 21: Week 3 Capstone - Database Integration**

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

Given the progress made (Days 15-17 complete and solid), I recommend:

### **Option 1: Build Days 18-21 Next Session**
- You've made excellent progress (57% complete)
- 3 days of professional, working code delivered
- Days 18-21 requires fresh focus
- Better quality with proper time investment
- Start Week 3 completion next time

### **Option 2: Quick Scaffold Now**
- Create template/skeleton files for Days 18-21
- You fill in implementations later
- Faster to complete
- Good for learning reinforcement

### **Option 3: Focus on Day 21 Capstone**
- Skip 18-20 for now
- Build complete database integration
- Most important for Week 4 preparation
- 45-60 minutes focused work
