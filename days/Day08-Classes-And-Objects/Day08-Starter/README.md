# Day 08 — Dependency Injection Basics

## 🎯 Week 2: API Sprint Begins

**Maya's Message:**
> "Week 1 is done. You know C# now. This week, we're building the heart of ServiceHub — the API. Every feature needs to be flexible, testable, and maintainable. That's what DI gives us."

Today, you'll learn **Dependency Injection** — the foundation for building a professional API that ServiceHub needs.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what dependency injection is and why it matters
- Register services in a DI container
- Inject dependencies into classes
- Write testable, loosely-coupled code

## Prerequisites
- Days 01-07 complete
- Comfortable with classes and interfaces
- ~60 minutes

---

## Starter Steps
1. Read the objectives above
2. Open this folder in Visual Studio (Open Folder recommended) or your editor
3. Follow the TODOs in the starter code
4. Build and run to verify

## Why This Matters for ServiceHub

ServiceHub's API needs to:
- Register repositories for database access
- Inject validators for business rules
- Swap implementations (e.g., real DB vs. test doubles)
- Stay flexible for future features

DI makes all of this possible.

## Next
Day 09: Build your first ServiceHub API endpoints with Minimal APIs.

## Boilerplate
- This folder contains minimal code and instructions to get started.
- Do not commit build artifacts; keep only source and instructions.
