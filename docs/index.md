# AscendCSharp30

**A 30-day, hands-on journey to mastering modern C# and .NET** through daily focused practice, real-world examples, and progressively complex projects.

Build strong foundations, then ship a full-stack application.

## 🎯 Your Mission: Build ServiceHub

Imagine this: **Maya Thompson** runs a small cleaning service. She tracks customers in a spreadsheet, work orders in email, and payments in a notebook. It's chaotic.

She hires you — the only developer on a tight 30-day deadline — to build **ServiceHub**: a simple operations platform where she can:
- ✅ Manage her customers
- ✅ Schedule work orders
- ✅ Track job status
- ✅ See a dashboard of today's schedule

**Here's the challenge:** You have 30 days to go from zero to shipped.

You'll learn C# by building real features. By Day 30, you'll have deployed a **full-stack SaaS app** that Maya (and others like her) can actually use to run their business.

**This is not a toy project. This is your capstone.**

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Week 1: Core C# Foundations (ServiceHub Domain Warmup)

Types, variables, control flow, collections, methods, LINQ, and a mini console project that uses the ServiceHub domain (customers, work orders, statuses) as a running example.

### Week 2: Building the ServiceHub API (Minimal API + DI + LINQ)

Dependency injection basics, Minimal APIs, DTOs and API contracts, async/await in web APIs, error handling with ProblemDetails, and LINQ-driven filtering/sorting for your ServiceHub endpoints.

### Week 3: Database + Blazor Foundations (Full-Stack ServiceHub)

EF Core setup and CRUD for the ServiceHub database, relationships between customers and work orders, project structure for your API, and the first Blazor pages that call your ServiceHub API.

### Week 4: Real-World Development & Deployment (Ship ServiceHub v1.0)

Component communication and app-wide state, authentication and authorization, UI polish (e.g., MudBlazor), logging and configuration, testing, deployment of API + Blazor, and final capstone release of ServiceHub MVP v1.0.

## 💡 How This Works

1. **Follow the Starter README** for each day (step-by-step guide)
2. **Build the mini-challenge** (hands-on coding)
3. **Compare to Complete example** (see the polished version)
4. **Move to the next day** (everything builds progressively)

No theory without practice. No practice without purpose.
