## The Journey

**Day 1** covers environment setup and tooling. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Day 1 starter README.

Each subsequent day builds on the previous one. By Day 30, you'll have built **ServiceHub** — a full-stack operations platform for service businesses.

## What is ServiceHub?

Throughout the 30 days, you're working toward a real capstone project:

- **Week 1:** Learn C# fundamentals using ServiceHub domain examples
- **Week 2:** Build an ASP.NET Core API for ServiceHub
- **Week 3:** Add EF Core database and Blazor UI
- **Week 4:** Implement auth, dashboard, and deploy
