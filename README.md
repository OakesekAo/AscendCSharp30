# AscendCSharp30 — A 30‑Day Journey to Mastering Modern C#

A structured, hands-on pathway to level up your C# and .NET skills through **daily focused practice**, **small projects**, and a **full-stack capstone application**.  
This repo contains each day's code, notes, challenges, and reflections as you ascend from fundamentals to real-world mastery.

---

## 🎯 Who This Journey Is For

AscendCSharp30 is built for developers who want a **clear, practical, and consistent plan** for learning modern C#:

- Self-taught developers strengthening C# fundamentals  
- Junior–mid developers growing into full-stack .NET roles  
- Developers switching from other languages (Python, JS, Java, PHP, etc.)  
- Anyone who prefers *building daily* over watching random tutorials  
- Developers preparing for real-world .NET jobs, freelance work, or interviews  

If you learn best by **doing**, this path is designed for you.

## 🚀 What You Will Accomplish (From Start → Finish)

By completing all 30 days, you will:

### **Build Strong C# Foundations**
- Types, collections, methods, LINQ  
- OOP done correctly (classes, interfaces, polymorphism)  
- Async/await, error handling, JSON, file IO  

### **Build Professional ASP.NET Core Skills**
- Dependency Injection (DI)  
- Logging patterns  
- Options/configuration  
- HttpClient + REST calls  
- Clean architecture basics  
- A working API built from scratch  

### **Become a Full-Stack .NET Developer**
- EF Core (CRUD, migrations, relationships)  
- Unit testing with xUnit  
- Blazor components + data binding  
- Blazor ↔ API integration  
- Authentication + authorization basics  
- Deployment fundamentals  

### **Ship a Full-Stack Capstone**
A complete full-stack mini-application using:

- ASP.NET Core Web API  
- EF Core (SQLite or PostgreSQL)  
- Blazor frontend (Server or WASM)  
- Logging, DI, configuration  
- One advanced feature (file upload, async job, caching, export, etc.)

This becomes a **GitHub-portfolio‑ready project** demonstrating real skills.

## 📦 ServiceHub — The Capstone Project

Throughout the 30 days, you're building **ServiceHub**: a lightweight operations platform for small local service businesses.

You'll gradually add features across all 30 days:
- **Week 1:** Learn C# using ServiceHub domain examples (customers, work orders, statuses)
- **Week 2:** Build a minimal ASP.NET Core API for ServiceHub data
- **Week 3:** Add EF Core persistence and Blazor UI components  
- **Week 4:** Implement authentication, dashboard, and deploy

## 📘 Learning Structure (Daily Format)

Every day takes **60–90 minutes**:

- **15–20 min** — Learn a concept  
- **30–45 min** — Hands-on coding  
- **10–15 min** — Mini challenge  
- **Optional** — Deeper exploration  

Each day has its own folder:
```

├── Day02-Types-And-Variables/
├── Day03-Control-Flow/
...
├── Day30-Capstone/

## 🧭 Why This Project Exists

Most C# learning is either:
- Too slow and academic, **or**
- Too fast and assumes you already know everything.

**AscendCSharp30 fixes both.**  
You get a predictable, progressive, hands-on learning journey that results in something real you can put on your portfolio.
